                    <p>Structured Query Language (SQL) is the set of statements with which all programs and users access data in an Oracle Database. Application programs and Oracle tools often allow users access to the database without using SQL directly, but these applications in turn must use SQL when executing the user's request </p>
                    <h3>History of SQL</h3>
                    <p>Dr. E. F. Codd published the paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks", in June 1970 in the Association of Computer Machinery (ACM) journal, Communications of the ACM. Codd's model is now accepted as the definitive model for relational database management systems (RDBMS). The language, Structured English Query Language (SEQUEL) was developed by IBM Corporation, Inc., to use Codd's model. SEQUEL later became SQL (still pronounced "sequel"). In 1979, Relational Software, Inc. (now Oracle) introduced the first commercially available implementation of SQL. Today, SQL is accepted as the standard RDBMS language.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>SQL Standards</h3>
                        <p>Oracle strives to comply with industry-accepted standards and participates actively in SQL standards committees. Industry-accepted committees are the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which is affiliated with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Both ANSI and the ISO/IEC have accepted SQL as the standard language for relational databases. When a new SQL standard is simultaneously published by these organizations, the names of the standards conform to conventions used by the organization, but the standards are technically identical.</p>
                        <h3>How SQL Works</h3>
                        <p>The strengths of SQL provide benefits for all types of users, including application programmers, database administrators, managers, and end users. Technically speaking, SQL is a data sublanguage. The purpose of SQL is to provide an interface to a relational database such as Oracle Database, and all SQL statements are instructions to the database. In this SQL differs from general-purpose programming languages like C and BASIC.</p>
                        <li>It processes sets of data as groups rather than as individual units.</li>
                        <li>It provides automatic navigation to the data.</li>
                        <li>It uses statements that are complex and powerful individually, and that therefore stand alone. Flow-control statements, such as begin-end, if-then-else, loops, and exception condition handling, were initially not part of SQL and the SQL standard, but they can now be found in ISO/IEC 9075-4 - Persistent Stored Modules (SQL/PSM). The PL/SQL extension to Oracle SQL is similar to PSM.</li>
                        <li>SQL lets you work with data at the logical level. You need to be concerned with the implementation details only when you want to manipulate the data. For example, to retrieve a set of rows from a table, you define a condition used to filter the rows. All rows satisfying the condition are retrieved in a single step and can be passed as a unit to the user, to another SQL statement, or to an application. You need not deal with the rows one by one, nor do you have to worry about how they are physically stored or retrieved. All SQL statements use the <span><b>optimizer</b></span>, a part of Oracle Database that determines the most efficient means of accessing the specified data. Oracle also provides techniques that you can use to make the optimizer perform its job better.</li>

                    <h3>SQL provides statements for a variety of tasks, including:</h3>
                            <li>Querying data</li>
                            <li>Inserting, updating, and deleting rows in a table</li>
                            <li>Creating, replacing, altering, and dropping objects</li>
                            <li>Controlling access to the database and its objects</li>
                            <li>Guaranteeing database consistency and integrity</li>
                            <p>SQL unifies all of the preceding tasks in one consistent language</p>
                        <h3>Common Language for All Relational Databases</h3>
                        <p>All major relational database management systems support SQL, so you can transfer all skills you have gained with SQL from one database to another. In addition, all programs written in SQL are portable. They can often be moved from one database to another with very little modification.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Lexical Conventions</h3>
                    <p>The following lexical conventions for issuing SQL statements apply specifically to the Oracle Database implementation of SQL, but are generally acceptable in other SQL implementations.
                    <p>When you issue a SQL statement, you can include one or more tabs, carriage returns, spaces, or comments anywhere a space occurs within the definition of the statement. Thus, Oracle Database evaluates the following two statements in the same manner:</p>
                </div>
                <pre class="result notranslate">
                SELECT last_name,salary*12,MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE,hire_date)
                FROM employeesWHERE department_id = 30 ORDER BY last_name;<br>
                SELECT last_name, salary * 12, MONTHS_BETWEEN( SYSDATE, hire_date)
                FROM employees WHERE department_id=30 ORDER BY last_name;
                </pre>
                <div>
                    <h3>Tools Support</h3>
                    <li>Oracle SQL Developer is a graphical tool that lets you browse, create, edit, and delete (drop) database objects, edit and debug PL/SQL code, run SQL statements and scripts, manipulate and export data, and create and view reports. With SQL Developer, you can connect to any target Oracle Database schema using standard Oracle Database authentication. Once connected, you can perform operations on objects in the database. You can also connect to schemas for selected third-party (non-Oracle) databases, such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Microsoft Access, view metadata and data in these databases, and migrate these databases to Oracle.</li>
                    <br><li>SQL*Plus is an interactive and batch query tool that is installed with every Oracle Database server or client installation. It has a command-line user interface and a Web-based user interface called iSQL*Plus.</li>
                    <br><li>Oracle JDeveloper is a multiple-platform integrated development environment supporting the complete lifecycle of development for Java, Web services, and SQL. It provides a graphical interface for executing and tuning SQL statements and a visual schema diagrammer (database modeler). It also supports editing, compiling, and debugging PL/SQL applications.</li>
                    <br><li>Oracle Application Express is a hosted environment for developing and deploying database-related Web applications. SQL Workshop is a component of Oracle Application Express that lets you view and manage database objects from a Web browser. SQL Workshop offers quick access to a SQL command processor and a SQL script repository.</li>
